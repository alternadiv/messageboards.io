        messageboards.io is my hobby project to help me learn web development things.<br><br>

        I am slowly building mb.io from scratch with only HTML and CSS because thatâ€™s what I find intriguing. A framework or CMS might be more efficient for professionals, but they aren't fun for tinkering as a hobbiest, in my opinion.<br><br>

        Lastly, I have a peculiar interest in 2000s-era web design aesthetics and old school forums aka message boards, hence this hand-picked collection of forums that I think are rad.<br><br>

        I hope sharing my list in the form of this website will be helpful to people looking for their [bbcode] nostalgia fix, even in 2023!<br><br>

            <h3>KRIYWT: <span class="snippet">"Keep reading if you want to."</span></h3>
            <p>
        I try to keep my writing and my code and my website designs short. I just want stuff to be utilitarian if you will. But if you chose to keep reading (you did), this part might be slippery.
