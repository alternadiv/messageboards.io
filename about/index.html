    messageboards.io is my hobby project to help me learn HTML, CSS, GitHub, SEO, and accessibility.<br><br>

    I am slowly building mb.io from scratch with just vanilla HTML and CSS because that’s what I like.<br><br>

    Lastly, I have a peculiar interest in 2000s-era web design aesthetics and old school forums aka message boards….<br><br>

    Hence this hand-picked collection of forums that I think are rad--aka mb.io.<br><br>

    I hope sharing my list in the form of this website will be helpful to people looking for their nostalgia fix of [bbcode] in 2023!<br><br>

    I try to keep my writing and my code and my website designs short. I just want stuff to be utilitarian if you will. But if you chose to keep reading (you did), this part might be slippery.
